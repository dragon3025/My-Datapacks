All: Datapack MCMeta Updated

	Horse Breeding Stat Fix:
*	Removed debugging particle that was accidentally left it.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Real Pet Chatter
*	Optimized Randomization
*	Overhauled the entire system. Now there is only 1 timer. It counts down except when certain events cause the timer to count up instead. Some events cause the timer to count all the way up to the limit. If the timer reaches 0, a new random limit is decided. Mobs will only make sound if the timer is above 0 or if a nearby player is looking at it.
*	When increasing there's a 20% chance for both increase by 2 and 0 for variance.
*	Reduced the range for angry mob sounds from 8 to 4 (to help prevent them from getting angry at mobs that can't be seen).
*	Uninstall function is more simple.
*	Compatiblity issue fixes for Silence Mobs and Silence Nearby Mobs Datapacks.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Spawn Blocking Beacon
*	Remove compatiblity note about light level display (because that pack was removed).
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Unused or Limited Stuff
*	Taming horses no longer emit heart particles.
*	You will receive a message when a horse is tamed, which helps know if you have an opportunity to transfer horse stats.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	(NEW) Bell Finds All Raiders
*	Ringing a bell will give glowing to all Raider mobs that are currently in a Raid.

	(NEW) Copy Horse stats
*	For up to 1 minute after Taming a Horse, you can use a trigger command to copy the Horse's stats to a nearby Zombie Horse or Skeleton horse, at the cost of 1 Ender Pearl.

	(NEW) Farmable Lush Cave Plants
*	You can now craft 1 Small Drip Leaf out of 1 Big Drip Leaf
*	You can now craft 2 Spore Blossoms out of 1 Spore Blossom + 4 Bonemeal

	(NEW) Fast Villager Curing
*	The wait time after curing a Zombie Villager is now 1 second or less.

	(NEW) Infinite Cauldrons
*	Toss kelp into a Cauldron. The Kelp will be consumed, and the Cauldron will then become an infinite water source.

	(NEW) Reverse Clay and Snow Crafting
*	Craft 4 Clay Balls from a Clay Block or 4 Snowballs from a Snow Block

	(NEW) Rabbits Don't Take Fall Damage
*	Rabbits are immune to fall damage.
*	Rabbits wont show landing particles when hitting the ground. This is due to the pack constantly telling the game that they've fallen 0 blocks. I don't think I can fix this.
