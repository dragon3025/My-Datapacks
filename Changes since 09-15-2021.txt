All: Datapack MCMeta Updated

	Dragon3025  Tweaks:
*	Removed stone to cobblestone recipe
*	Removed TNT Bedrock destroying (Bedrock destroying methods are now easier and 100% successful when performed correctly).
*	Transfered Bell Raider Finding, Infinite Cauldron Water, and Rabbit Fall Damage Immunity features into their own packs.
*	Removed obsidian melting. It was created to fix accidental obsidian flooding around builds, but this isn't a common thing and the function is a little overpowered.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Horse Breeding Stat Fix:
*	Removed debugging particle that was accidentally left it.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Mob Control:
*	Zombie Reinforcement restricting features removed
*	You will receive a message when a horse is tamed, which helps know if you have an opportunity to transfer horse stats.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Real Pet Chatter
*	Optimized Randomization
*	Overhauled the entire system. Now there is only 1 timer. It counts down except when certain events cause the timer to count up instead. Some events cause the timer to count all the way up to the limit. If the timer reaches 0, a new random limit is decided. Mobs will only make sound if the timer is above 0 or if a nearby player is looking at it.
*	When increasing there's a 20% chance for both increase by 2 and 0 for variance.
*	Reduced the range for angry mob sounds from 8 to 4 (to help prevent them from getting angry at mobs that can't be seen).
*	Uninstall function is more simple.
*	Compatiblity issue fixes for Silence Mobs and Silence Nearby Mobs Datapacks.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Spawn Blocking Beacon
*	Remove compatiblity note about light level display (because that pack was removed).
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	Unused or Limited Stuff
*	Taming horses no longer emit heart particles.
*	You will receive a message when a horse is tamed, which helps know if you have an opportunity to transfer horse stats.
*	Optimized Function Timer System.

	(NEW) Bell Finds All Raiders
*	Ringing a bell will give glowing to all Raider mobs that are currently in a Raid.

	(NEW) Farmable Lush Cave Plants
*	You can now craft 1 Small Drip Leaf out of 1 Big Drip Leaf
*	You can now craft 2 Spore Blossoms out of 1 Spore Blossom + 4 Bonemeal

	(NEW) Infinite Cauldrons
*	Toss kelp into a Cauldron. The Kelp will be consumed, and the Cauldron will then become an infinite water source.

	(NEW) Rabbits Don't Take Fall Damage
*	Rabbits are immune to fall damage.
*	Rabbits wont show landing particles when hitting the ground. This is due to the pack constantly telling the game that they've fallen 0 blocks. I don't think I can fix this.
